## Getting Started 🚀

To get started, you have to install `mason_cli` first

```shell
dart pub global activate mason_cli
```

or using `homebrew`

```shell
brew tap felangel/mason
brew install mason
```

### Initialization

Run `mason init` to initialize mason in the current project directory. This will generate a `mason.yaml` and allow mason to work with bricks scoped locally within the workspace.

### Install

Head to `mason.yaml`, then add lines to the `bricks` section:

```yaml
# Register bricks which can be consumed via the Mason CLI.
# Run "mason get" to install all registered bricks.
# To learn more, visit https://docs.brickhub.dev.
bricks:
  # Bricks can be imported via version constraint from a registry.
  # Uncomment the following line to import the "hello" brick from BrickHub.
  # hello: 0.1.0+1
  # Bricks can also be imported via remote git url.
```

after that run `mason get` to download bricks from the repository.

Make sure you're under project's root directory. Then run and fill the rest

```shell
mason make BRICKS_NAME 
```

Happy coding! 🥳🎉
