## Getting Started ðŸš€

To get started, you have to install `mason_cli` first

```shell
dart pub global activate mason_cli
```

or using `homebrew`

```shell
brew tap felangel/mason
brew install mason
```

### Initialization

Run `mason init` to initialize mason in the current project directory. This will generate a `mason.yaml` and allow mason to work with bricks scoped locally within the workspace.

### Install
Go to each package for further instruction of installation

Happy coding! ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰
